# Question-Answering-using-DistilBert

Working on the code right now, the model.fit snippet has problems, any contributions are welcome :)
Have provided another prepare_features code, also works fine with better results but the model.fit still has errors.


For dataset, [train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-stanford-question-answering-dataset?select=train.csv) and [validation.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-stanford-question-answering-dataset?select=validation.csv) are used
